## Install

Dependencies:

1. `npm`
1. `yarn`
1. `git`

```bash
git clone
yarn
```

## Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn start
```

Note: Icon in development will default to Electron icon even though NinjaTerm icon will be used when packaging for releases, see [https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/1710#issuecomment-414199480](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/1710#issuecomment-414199480).

**Running Tests**

```bash
yarn build # Only needed if app has not been built via other means yet
yarn test
```

**Running Lint Checks**

```bash
yarn lint
```

**Running Typescript Checks**

```bash
yarn tsc
```

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
yarn package
```

Packages are created in the `release` directory. Because the native module `serialport` is used, each package has to be built on it's respective platform.

Packaging is performed by the `electron-builder` library. The config for this is contained within the top-level `package.json` under `"build"`.

Version number is contained within the "inner" `package.json` at `src/package.json`.

## CICD

GitHib Actions are used for running automated tests and creating releases (which include built and packaged executables for all supported platforms).
